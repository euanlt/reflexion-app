- **~970 lines** of documentation
- **Total: ~2,770 lines**

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully
# ✓ All type checks passed
# ✓ Static pages generated
```

⚠️ **Note**: Minor warnings from OBS SDK dependencies (log4js) are normal and don't affect functionality.

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Set Up Huawei Cloud Account
Follow the comprehensive guide:
```bash
docs/huawei-cloud-setup.md
```

### 2. Create OBS Bucket
- Login to Huawei Cloud Console
- Create OBS bucket (e.g., `reflexion-movement-analysis`)
- Configure CORS settings
- Set bucket to private

### 3. Generate Access Credentials
- Create Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
- Store securely (password manager recommended)
- Never commit to version control

### 4. Configure Local Environment
```bash
# Copy template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your credentials
HUAWEI_OBS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
HUAWEI_OBS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
HUAWEI_OBS_ENDPOINT=obs.ap-southeast-1.myhuaweicloud.com
HUAWEI_OBS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```

### 5. Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to Movement Analysis
# Record and save a video
# Verify upload in OBS console
```

### 6. Configure Vercel
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Add all four environment variables
- Apply to Production, Preview, and Development
- Redeploy

### 7. Verify Production
- Deploy to Vercel
- Test movement analysis save functionality
- Check OBS console for uploaded files
- Verify signed URLs work correctly

## Testing Checklist

## Architecture Highlights

### Hybrid Storage Approach

### Benefits
✅ Unlimited cloud storage scalability  
✅ Fast local metadata access  
✅ Offline capability (view metadata)  
✅ Automatic sync when online  
✅ Retry failed uploads  
✅ Secure server-side credentials  

## Cost Estimate

For **1,000 users**, each recording **5 videos/month**:

**Storage:**
- 5 videos × 1,000 users × 5MB = 25GB
- Cost: 25GB × $0.02/GB = **$0.50/month**

**Requests:**
- 5,000 uploads × $0.005/1,000 = **$0.025/month**

**Total: ~$0.53/month** (excluding data transfer)

Very cost-effective! 💰

## Security Checklist

- [x] Server-side credentials only
- [x] Private bucket
- [x] Temporary signed URLs
- [x] HTTPS enforcement
- [x] CORS configured
- [ ] Enable OBS encryption (SSE-KMS) - Recommended
- [ ] Set up bucket logging - Recommended
- [ ] Configure lifecycle rules - Recommended
- [ ] Use IAM user instead of root - Recommended
- [ ] Rotate keys every 90 days - Recommended

## Known Limitations

1. **Video Size**: No hard limit set (consider adding client-side validation)
2. **Concurrent Uploads**: No queue system (uploads happen immediately)
3. **Bandwidth**: No upload throttling (consider for mobile networks)
4. **Authentication**: Uses random userId (should integrate with real auth system)
5. **Error Recovery**: Manual retry only (consider auto-retry background jobs)

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Suggested)
- [ ] Batch upload for multiple videos
- [ ] Video transcoding (optimize format/size)
- [ ] Thumbnail generation
- [ ] Analysis history page
- [ ] Search and filter saved analyses
- [ ] Download functionality
- [ ] PDF export of reports
- [ ] Data sharing with caregivers
- [ ] Auto-cleanup old videos (lifecycle rules)
- [ ] CDN integration for global access

### Production Readiness
- [ ] User authentication integration
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Rate limiting on API routes
- [ ] Usage analytics
- [ ] Admin panel
- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Multi-region support
