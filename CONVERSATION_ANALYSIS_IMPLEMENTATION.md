### 2. Conversation Analysis Page Enhancements

**Updated:** `app/conversation-analysis/page.tsx`

#### Added Live Video Feed During Recording

**New Features:**

- ✅ **Full-screen video display** in 16:9 aspect ratio
- ✅ **Proper camera feed handling** (starts when recording begins, stops when recording ends)

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Added video ref for live feed
const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement | null>(null)
const streamRef = useRef<MediaStream | null>(null)

// Display video preview when recording starts
if (videoRef.current) {
  videoRef.current.srcObject = stream
  videoRef.current.play()
}

// Clean up video feed when recording stops
if (videoRef.current) {
  videoRef.current.srcObject = null
}
stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop())
```

**UI Enhancements:**
```tsx
<div className="relative bg-black rounded-lg overflow-hidden aspect-video">
  <video
    ref={videoRef}
    autoPlay
    muted
    playsInline
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
  
  {/* REC Indicator */}
  <div className="absolute top-4 left-4 bg-red-600 ...">
    <span className="w-2 h-2 bg-white rounded-full animate-pulse"></span>
    REC
  </div>
  
  {/* Timer Overlay */}
  <div className="absolute top-4 right-4 bg-black/50 ...">
    {formatTime(recordedTime)} / {formatTime(selectedType.duration)}
  </div>
</div>
```

## 🎨 Design Decisions

1. **Why show video during recording?**
   - Professional medical/assessment feel
   - Visual feedback builds trust
   - Users can adjust position/lighting
   - Standard practice in video assessments

2. **Why muted playback?**
   - Prevents audio feedback loop
   - User hears own voice naturally, not through speakers
   - Standard for self-view in video apps

3. **Why REC indicator?**
   - Clear visual confirmation recording is active
   - Pulsing animation draws attention
   - Standard UX pattern (familiar from cameras/phones)

4. **Why timer overlay?**
   - Users know how long they've been talking
   - Helps pace their response
   - Prevents surprise auto-stop

5. **Why purple theme?**
   - Distinct from other assessments (blue, green, orange)
   - Associated with creativity/thinking
   - Matches conversation/communication theme

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- ✅ Camera permission required (browser standard)
- ✅ User sees what's being recorded
- ✅ Recordings stay local (until cloud save implemented)
- ✅ Clear recording indicator (REC badge)
- ✅ User control (stop anytime)
- ✅ No surprise recording

## 📈 Impact
